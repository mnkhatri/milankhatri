<h1>Brief history of Mathematics</h1>
<div class="intromath">
<p>We donâ€™t know exactly when and from where Mathematics had been begun.It is predicted that it had begun with counting 50000 years ago and developed together with the development of human being with the need of human society to reduce the difficulty in human life and make the life easier.</p><br>
<p>In stone age, there was no numerals as we have today.At that time,people used to draw tally mark for each object(it has proof),they might have used one pebble for each object(it is a guess),they used to use knots in the strings as the number of objects(it is statement).After many year,people begun to use their fingers for counting numbers.</p><br>
<p>When people felt that above techniques are not sufficient to deal with new life challenges (desire/natural requirement?), then they had developed the various number systems: Roman numbers system, Hindu arabic numerals (developed by Hindu and Arabians spread all over the world) etc.,computing devices and modern mathematics.
